            <div>When I was a young kid I was always interested in cooking mainly because I was more passionate about snacks and desserts. My mom used to make these  treats every weekend but I would finish them as soon as they got of the pan. After finishing all these snacks I would always want more and the best way to ensure that I had enough was to make it myself. I started learning more and more recipes and soon enough whenever my friends visited me I started cooking for them.
            Traditionally Indian cooking recipes are passed on from mother to daughter, I have learnt several authentic recipes from my mother, grand-mother and my mother-in-law. I have also traveled to various places and tried several cuisines. I enjoy tasting food from street vendors to star-hotels. Each time I taste a different dish, I try to make the dish at home and vary the ingredients. I have made a careful record of these home-tested recipes. I enjoy cooking and tasting food. I have been cooking for more than 15 years. Cooking is my passion and I always enjoyed making new recipes from different cuisines. 

I just started this blog a few months ago and so it may not have all the recipes that you are looking for. But I will be adding several new recipes every week and sure the recipes blog will grow. In the meanwhile if you really need any particular recipe. Please mention it in the comments section below and I will post that recipe at a prioritized pace. Once again thank you for visiting Steffi's Recipes and your continued support. Together let's SPREAD THE JOY OF COOKING !!
